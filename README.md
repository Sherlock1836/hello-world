GitHub Hello World Assignment for CSC 430

My name is Isaac Reynolds and at this time, I'm a junior at Murray State University. I'm a computer science major, and I like getting to work with all the different modern technologies. Rocket League is another big passion of mine, and I have been captain of Murray State's Rocket League Blue team for a year now. This summer (2024) I worked at CSI as a software engineering intern and worked on migrating the AngularJS frontend of an app called POD+ to pure, modern Angular. I also did some debugging on the front end and got to see/work with their .NET backend and SQL database as well.
